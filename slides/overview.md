# Overview

Let's say you're sitting in your Microsoft shop with your Microsoft Stack. 

Things are humming along just find. You've built a ton of useful products for your organization. 

There's a few spots that haven't been built out, but they're all Developer facing, not User facing, so it's **fine**

Narrator: Actually, it's not fine

You keep builing more and more cool stuff, but none of the 'configuration' UIs are created.

The way things get updated is all based on institutional knowledge ... in the greybeard's head

Some stuff is written down ... but it's kind of cryptic and new hires can't really follow it
